    <p>efore doing anything, you need some ideas. What should your website actually do? A website can do basically anything, but, for your first try, you should keep things simple. We'll start by creating a simple webpage with a heading, an image, and a few paragraphs.

        To begin, you'll need to answer these questions:
        
            What is your website about? Do you like dogs, New York, or Pac-Man?
            What information are you presenting on the subject? Write a title and a few paragraphs and think of an image you'd like to show on your page.
            What does your website look like, in simple high-level terms? What's the background color? What kind of font is appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle?
